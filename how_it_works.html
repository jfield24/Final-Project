            <h1>A machine learning model was created to predict the outcomes of tennis matches in the Australian Open 2021. In creating the model, data from every ATP tournament from 2011-2021 was sourced from tennis-data.co.uk as well as supplemented from xscores.com. The model included several inputs, some examples of these inputs are the player's head to head statistics, overall win percentages, how they play on hard court, rankings, points, and recent form. Training and testing the model has demonstrated an accuracy of 76.8%. Multiple hidden layers are included in the model which adjust the weighting of the various inputs. The output layer uses Sigmoid - the ideal output layer for probabilities between 0 and 1 (the only possible probabilities in a tennis match). The loss function uses binary cross-entropy - the recommended loss function for binary data. To use this website continuing to the Prediction page will allow you to select all possible matches from the Quarter Finals onward - and probabilities of win and implied odds are given for each player. It is envisaged that the implied odds are compared to gambling odds and utilised to more accurately assess the market i.e. a stake would be best placed on the player whose implied odds are lower than a price you are able to bet at. Results from this experiment so far are on the results page. Disclaimer: Please don't take this as gospel (I take no responsibility for ANY losses incurred as a result of anyone using this model for gambling purposes.</h1>
