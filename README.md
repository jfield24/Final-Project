# Australian Open Tennis Predictor - Artificial Neural Network Model

---

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a Machine Learning model to predict the outcomes and probabilties of the remaining possible Australian Open matches (some quarter finals and the possible semi-finals and final matches were predicted. Data from 2011-2021 was used in training the model.

## How to look through the code

1. Inputs of the model can be found in `/utils/features.py`, these were added to the model using lambda apply in `Adding_Features_to_the_Model.ipynb`.
2. Scraping data from matches in the current Australian Open can be found in `Scraping_Aus_Open_Results.ipynb`.
3. Training and testing of the model, hidden layers, output layer, and loss function + predicting the current Aus Open matches can be found in `Aus_Open_Predictor.ipynb`
